# 📊 Data Preprocessing & EDA for Machine Learning

This repository contains the complete **data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** pipeline used before training a machine learning model.  
It demonstrates how raw datasets are cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling.

This project focuses on the **most critical step of any ML pipeline: data preparation before model building.**

## 🔍 Project Overview

Before training any machine learning model, raw data must be cleaned and processed properly.  
In this project, I worked on **two datasets** and performed:

- Data loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Data normalization & encoding
- Dataset preparation for ML training

This repository is meant to represent the **"Before Model Training"** phase of an ML workflow.
